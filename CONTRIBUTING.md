# The Collaboration Rules

1. Please don't push to the `main branch`, please create your own a feature or bug-fix branch off of the main branch, then, push that and then create a `Pull Request` Any direct pushes to main is possible, but stronly discourged and subject to `deletion` via rollback.

1. Feel free to use GitHub's Issue to for general comments, report bugs or add a feature request

1. Use Issues to discuss Pull Request motivations, accolades or reasons why things were not merged into main

1. lint and format with VS Code ( or any other editor you can write clean elegantly formatted code )
