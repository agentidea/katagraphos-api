# The Collaboration Rules

1. Please don't push to main branch, create a feature or bug branch, push that and open a pull request. Any direct pushes to main is possible, but discourged and subject to `deletion` via rollback.

1. Feel free to Open and Issue to report bugs or add a feature request

1. Use Issues to discuss Pull Request motivations, accolades or reasons why things were not merged into main

1. lint and format with VS Code ( or any other editor you can write clean elegantly formatted code )
1. use a spell checker
1. be mindful and thing critically
1. no abuse or discrimination in comments, code or issues, in any way will be tolerated
