# The Idea

This is an API to create durable and versionable tabular records ( text only for now ) manipulated with PowerShell ( ImportExcel Module by Doug Finke ) command-lets and then persisted in a GitHub repository via PSAdvantage a powerful GH cli wrapper.  

At some point `Authentication` is addressed via Excel's built in read-only OR read/write password.  

API resided in a docker container, currently running on a Digital Ocean droplet (Ubuntu).  The REST API is served from the PowerShell webserver called `pode` 


# How the name Katagraphos came to be?
History of the name Katagrapho(s) is when googling the Greek word for `record` I came across the Greek word `Katagrapho`

Katagrapho is a verb meaning:

* to write
* to draw forms or figures
* to delineate
* to mark

I wanted the `plural` so I added the `s`  ( hence Records )
