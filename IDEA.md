## How the name Katagraphos came to be?

Perhaps, one may have a need to create secure and durable tabular records?

Instead of using the name Record API, the use the Greek Language can be useful to create a name and namespace that is unique.

### The meaning and etemology

 When googling the Greek word for `record` I came across the Greek word `Katagrapho`

Katagrapho is a verb meaning:

* to write
* to draw forms or figures
* to delineate
* to mark

I wanted the `plural` so I added the `s`  ( hence Records )

Hence the URL http://katagraphos.net was chosen.  

### The .net suffix? 

Network?  It feels like there could be inconnections.  it's a personal private, or public network [sic]

e.g. **All** of Grant's records

   `GET https://katagraphos.net/api/record/Grant.Steinfeld`

e.g. **Specific** record Grant has

   `GET https://katagraphos.net/api/record/Grant.Steinfeld/MyBudget`

if private `secret` is passed in encrypted http header?
